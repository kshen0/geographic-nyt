Sixty-five whales, some of them 20 feet long and weighing up to a ton, became stranded in a salt marsh Tuesday night. By late yesterday all had died. Robert Prescott, director of the Audubon Society's wildlife sanctuary at Wellfleet Bay, said that, because of size, the whales could not be returned to the water. He said the beaching of a large number of whales on the island ''happens frequently, every 25 years or so.''",
